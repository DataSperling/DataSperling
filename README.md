### Interests: 
- Intersection of traditional software development (Java, Spring, REST, SQL) and data science (Python, R, Scala, Spark, CNN) 
- Application of these technologies to scientific problems.









### Current Projects:
- soundable: Client server application which integrates machine learning to identify real-world audio samples.
- soundable-ML: CNN pipeline to develop AI models for audio recognition suitable for integration into REST-API's. 
- soundable-FX: JavaFX client for preprocessing audio data for efficient onward transmission.
- soundable-API: REST API to serve, store and search data for soundable-FX client.
